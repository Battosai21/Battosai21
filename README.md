Hi champ, thanks for stopping by.
I am just a frustrated software engineer with a skill issue. I would rather work as an airline pilot, but I don't have the money to study that.
Here is where I come to cry over my broken dreams. And also the place where I upload some projects from time to time. Feel free to check them and take anything you need. I also served myself from the internet when making these.
